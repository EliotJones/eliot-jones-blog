# PostHaste #

I haven't blogged in a while, simply because I've not thought of any interesting topics to blog about, hopefully something will come along sooner or later!

In the meantime I'm promoting my little Visual Studio extension, [PostHaste][link0].

This extension aims to make sending code to [hastebin][link1] (it's like a good version of PasteBin) from inside Visual Studio easier. Not that it could be much easier but it seemed like a fun way to learn Visual Studio extensibility.

It's (hopefully) compatible with Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, why not give it a try? :)
